nice work.  most of these comments are minor clarification or some organizational improvements.

- the first paragraph is a bit wordy at times

- I don't have any suggestions (not sure if it can be improved), but it's a bit cumbersome working from 1-4 as eq 1 has a lot of variables you define, as defined in 2 and 3, with a bunch more stuff, as defined in 4.

- Model verification section is hard to parse.  Lots of numbers and similar phrases.  The errors seem much larger than the pictures suggest.  What is this error relative to?  

- The Horns Rev comparisons using 1 sample  - one sample


- For the remainder of the results analysis we have used only calculations with 100 samples across the rotor-swept area - this is confusing because you say optimization only uses 1 sample.
